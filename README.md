    out and refill light pickup.

### Subsection Boss:

dodge hands if they have a light source, but it will stop attacking for a moment if play has no light. If the player
has no light for a long time and does nothing, the boss will randomly attack but the player can tell which side the
attack is on by the eye blinking. The Player will need to toss light for the boss to attack and then the player can attack.
